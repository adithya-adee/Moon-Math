# Moon-Math

zk-SNARKs remain somewhat elusive or ”magical” and are therefore sometimes coined as ”moon math”.

zk-SNARKs are intriguing because they allow for the honest
computation of data to be proven publicly without disclosing the inputs to the computation,
through the transmission of a concise transaction to a verifier embodied as a smart contract
on a public blockchain
